# google-maps-jq
App for secondary school course "Web Apps" made with google maps and jQuery

Not everything is working properly and the code is quite a big mess XD.

The target of that project was to get familiar with using Google maps API with jQuery and how to store simple application state on a server and in local storage.
Also creating simple components from scratch like: resizable panel, input range, and color picker.

The idea of project and code samples was provided by the lecturer on the course.
